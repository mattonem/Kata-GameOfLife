# Kata-GameOfLife
A very strange and oddly satifying Game Of Life implementation.

My goal was to make implement the John Conway's Game of Life in such a manner that we don't have to go through all cells of the game to compute t+1...

It uses announcement a lot (too much)...

_The bloc interface may fail from time to time to refresh some cells. But the model remains valid all time._
